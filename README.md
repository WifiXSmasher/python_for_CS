This is a python script for your own HTTP_server and i have added the general functionality of a HTTP_server

This script can perform the following functionality:
 
1. give a 200 response for the correct request 

2. give a 400 response if any directory other than the ("/")  directory is present (you can change that to your liking)

3. keep the server running for multipe requests using the concept of theading

4. this scrit can also write a file in the machine for a "POST" type request
