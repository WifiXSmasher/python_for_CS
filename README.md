This is a python script for your own HTTP_server and i have added the general functionality of a HTTP_server

This script can perform the following functionality:
 
1. give a 200 response for the correct request 

2. give a 400 response if any directory other than the ("/")  directory is present (you can change that to your liking)

3. keep the server running for multipe requests using the concept of theading

4. this scrit can also write a file in the machine for a "POST" type request

5. i have used threading so that the server remains open until a "KEYBOARDINTERRUPT"

6. this script also accept POST request.

P.S: this script was made to complete the codecrafters challange of "making your own HTTP SERVER"
